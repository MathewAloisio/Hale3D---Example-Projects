Hale3D skybox format specification:

NOTE: Indentation in the specification represents the need for a loop to read the data.
	 The # of occurances of a data-type will be listed just before the indent, beside the type.

DESCRIPTION: A file that holds a skybox consisting of 6 TGA images, one per face.
	 
File extension: .skybox
	 
.:Little Endian byte order:.
(1)  Bytes: 0->4		= ID							  (uint32_t)
(2)  Bytes: 4->8		= Version						  (uint32_t)
(3)	 Bytes: 8->Varies	= Shader path					  (std::string)
(4)  Bytes: ??			= Image data.					  (TGAManager * 6)
		-- TGAManager --
		(4.a) CubeFace::Right							  (TGAManager)
		(4.b) CubeFace::Left							  (TGAManager)
		(4.c) CubeFace::Top							  	  (TGAManager)
		(4.d) CubeFace::Bottom							  (TGAManager)
		(4.e) CubeFace::Front 							  (TGAManager)
		(4.f) CubeFace::Back							  (TGAManager)
		
Remarks: 
		(1.) ID should be equal to ('B' << 24) + ('Y' << 16) + ('K' << 8) + 'S', which resolves to 1113148243.

Relevant structure(s):
	enum class CubeFace : uint8_t {
		Right,
		Left,
		Top,
		Bottom,
		Front,
		Back
	};
	typedef EnumerateArray<CubeFace, TGAManager, 6> CubemapFaceArray;
